            information available regarding "Sindhutowers" in Chittoor.
             It's possible that it could be a new development or project that has emerged after my last update. 
             Without further context or information, I'm unable to provide details on what Sindhutowers might refer to in Chittoor.
              If it's a newly established landmark or project, you may want to consult local sources or news outlets for more information.
