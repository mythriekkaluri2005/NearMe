            KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) having a presence in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh. 
            KFC is a multinational fast-food restaurant chain known for its fried chicken products.
            However, KFC frequently expands its operations to various cities and towns across India.
            Therefore, it's possible that KFC may have established a presence in Chittoor since my last update.
